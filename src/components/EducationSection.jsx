    <h2>Understanding Soil pH</h2>
    <p>Soil pH measures the acidity or alkalinity of soil, affecting plant growth:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Acidic (pH less than 7 ):</strong> Good for blueberries, azaleas.</li>
      <li><strong>Neutral (pH = 7):</strong> Ideal for most crops.</li>
      <li><strong>Alkaline (pH greater 7):</strong> Suitable for asparagus, spinach.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Tip: Test your soil regularly and adjust with lime (to raise pH) or sulfur (to lower pH) as needed.</p>
  </div>
